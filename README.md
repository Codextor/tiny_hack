Simple 10-day hacks

## The Challenge
You have **10 days** to **create a project of your choice**. The projects can be of any type ranging from an mobile app to digital artwork, video, food recipe or anything that you want to make and share with the world. That's  not it, once you are done with building your project. Next thing **share it with the world** and **get validations from people**(your friends, family, and the community) on the awesomeness of your app.( get upvotes on github PR as :heart:, :heart_eyes:, :thumbsup:, :tada: or whatever else you feel like :sunflower: )
